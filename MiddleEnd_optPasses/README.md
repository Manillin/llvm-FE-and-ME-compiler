# LLVM Optimization Passes

This repository contains a series of assignments focused on implementing various optimization passes for the middle-end of a compiler using the LLVM framework. Each assignment requires writing C++ code to manipulate and optimize the LLVM intermediate representation (IR).

## Overview of LLVM Middle-End Optimizations

The middle-end of a compiler is responsible for transforming and optimizing the intermediate representation (IR) of the code. This phase aims to improve the performance and efficiency of the generated code without altering its semantics. LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) provides a robust framework for developing such optimizations through custom passes written in C++.

### Assignments

The repository is organized into four main assignments, each targeting specific optimization techniques:

### 1. Algebraic Identity, Strength Reduction, Multi-Instruction Optimizations

This assignment involves implementing optimizations that simplify algebraic expressions, reduce computational strength, and optimize multiple instructions. 

- **Algebraic Identity**: Simplifies expressions by applying algebraic identities. For example, replacing `x * 1` with `x` or `x + 0` with `x`.
- **Strength Reduction**: Replaces expensive operations with equivalent but less costly operations. For instance, converting `x * 2` to `x << 1`.
- **Multi-Instruction Optimizations**: Combines or eliminates redundant instructions to reduce the overall instruction count and improve performance.

### 2. Data Flow Analysis

Although not a true optimization pass, this assignment focuses on analyzing the flow of data through the instructions. Data flow analysis is crucial for understanding dependencies and identifying opportunities for optimization.

- **Instruction Analysis**: Examines the usage, definition, and lifetime of variables to determine how data moves through the program. This information is used by other passes to perform optimizations like dead code elimination and register allocation.

### 3. Loop Invariant Code Motion (LICM)

Loop Invariant Code Motion (LICM) is an optimization that moves invariant code out of loops. Code that does not change within the loop can be moved outside, reducing the amount of work done inside the loop.

- **Invariant Detection**: Identifies instructions within loops that produce the same result on every iteration.
- **Code Motion**: Moves these invariant instructions outside the loop to execute them only once, thus reducing the loop's overall execution time.

### 4. Loop Fusion

Loop Fusion is an optimization that combines adjacent loops that iterate over the same range into a single loop. This can improve cache performance and reduce loop overhead.

- **Fusion Analysis**: Analyzes loops to determine if they can be safely combined without changing the program's behavior.
- **Fusion Implementation**: Merges compatible loops into a single loop, reducing loop overhead and potentially improving data locality and cache performance.
